# AppleCardImportGUI
A GUI to import Apple Card statements to Mint

Currently a work in progress, this is a GUI to import CSV Apple Card statements directly to your Mint account using a modified script from https://github.com/nathanielkam/mint-csv-import

The code has been reworked to utilize Apple Card statements in CSV format and the GUI is being built from the ground up using the Toga toolkit.
